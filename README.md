Please follow below steps

- Run composer install

- Run php artisan db:seed (Run database seeder for usertypes to use - )
- 
- Two APIâ€™s are given to register and login with user.
    - No Admin registration is allowed
    - Admin can only login.
    - Once Admin user will be created using seeder, with role as admin.
    - When seeder will  run it will create two users admin and user.
    
- Test cases are not complete due to time constraints and as I am relatively new to testing, I have studied about writing and then written them.
- Test cases uses a hard coded token for protected method, so they may break. I assure I will learn to fix this problem, asap. 

- Postman API documentation is attached in the email :
